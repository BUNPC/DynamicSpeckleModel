# DynamicSpeckleModel




Our dynamic speckle model simulates the evolution of the speckle intensity pattern by calculating the superposition of the light fields scattered from multiple locations.


To run the code you need to:

%Download all the Matlab files into one folder
%Run demo.m
%To modify the optical properties of the biological medium and the incident beam geometry, change the corresponding parameters in ModelSetting.m
%After you run the demo.m provided, the input and output wavefront and xz cross section profiles should look like this:
