# DynamicSpeckleModel




Our dynamic speckle model simulates the evolution of the speckle intensity pattern by calculating the superposition of the light fields scattered from multiple locations.

For any issue reporting or suggestions, please contact Sharvari Zilpelwar, sharz@bu.edu

Notes:

Calculate the speckle size from sSize_Calculator.m and input the sSize value in the DSM.m code.
