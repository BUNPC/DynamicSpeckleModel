# DynamicSpeckleModel




Our dynamic speckle model simulates the evolution of the speckle intensity pattern by calculating the superposition of the light fields scattered from multiple locations.


To run the code:
1) Download all the .m files in one folder
2) Run demo.m
  - To modify the scattering properties and the detector properties, change the corresponding parameters in ModelSettings.m


The demo.m outputs the speckle contrast as a function of exposure time, speckle pattern measured at exposure time 1 and 100 mus and sigma(K) for 10 configurations:

The sigma(K) is improved by increasing Nconfig.
