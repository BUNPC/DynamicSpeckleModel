# DynamicSpeckleModel




Our dynamic speckle model simulates the evolution of the speckle intensity pattern by calculating the superposition of the light fields scattered from multiple locations.


To run the code you need to:
1) Download all the .m files in one folder
2) Run demo.m
  - To modify the scattering properties of the biological medium and the detector properties, change the corresponding parameters in ModelSettings.m

Notes:

Calculate the speckle size from sSize_Calculator.m and input the sSize value in the DSM.m code.


The demo.m should output the speckle contrast as a function of exposure time, speckle pattern measured at exposure time 1 and 100 mus and the noise in the speckle contrast sigma(K).
